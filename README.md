Analyzing NYC High School Data

New York City has published data on the [SAT scores of students](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4), along with additional demographic datasets. 

- [SAT scores of students](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) -- SAT scores for each high school in New York City.
    
- [School attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statistics-by-Dis/7z8d-msnt) -- attendance information on every school in NYC.
    
- [Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3) -- class size information for each school in NYC.
    
- [AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/AP-College-Board-2010-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e) -- Advanced Placement exam results for each high school. Passing AP exams can get you college credit in the US.
    
- [Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Classes-Of-2005-2010-School-Le/vh2h-md7a) -- percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information.
    
- [Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Demographics-and-Accountability-Snapshot-20/ihfw-zy9j) -- demographic information for each school.

- [School survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/NYC-School-Survey-2011/mnz3-dyi8) -- surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school.

New York City has a significant immigrant population, and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to figure out if the SAT is a fair test. If certain racial groups consistently performed better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair, for example.
